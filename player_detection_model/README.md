Here’s a complete and clean **`README.md`** you can use for your project, assuming your project uses a player detection model:

---

### ✅ `README.md`

```markdown
# 🧠 Player Detection AI System

This project uses a deep learning model to detect players from video streams or images. Due to GitHub's file size limits, the trained model file (`best.pt`) is hosted externally and downloaded automatically.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time player detection using a YOLOv5-based model
- Lightweight download mechanism for large `.pt` files
- Easy-to-run setup with minimal dependencies

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```

your\_project/
├── player\_detection\_model/
│   └── models/
│       └── best.pt  ← (auto-downloaded)
├── download\_model.py
├── requirements.txt
└── main.py (or your detection script)

````

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the model file**

   ```bash
   python download_model.py
   ```

---

## 🧠 Model Info

* Model: `best.pt`
* Size: \~186 MB
* Format: PyTorch (`.pt`)
* Trained on: Custom player detection dataset

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Once everything is set up, you can run the detection script:

```bash
python main.py
```

(Replace `main.py` with your actual script name.)

---

## 🔻 Downloading Model Manually (Optional)

If the download script fails, you can manually download it from Google Drive:

**Direct link:**
[Download best.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PKG4i0UX-jigDAJ5kEZEd3GiqDXuLHhp/view?usp=sharing)

Place the file in:

```
player_detection_model/models/best.pt
```
