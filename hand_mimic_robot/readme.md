# 🖐️ 6DOF Robotic Hand Mimicry Simulation (MediaPipe + Python)

This project tracks the user's hand in real-time using **MediaPipe** and simulates a **6DOF robotic hand** that mimics the movement. It runs entirely on **Windows**, with no hardware required — purely simulation using Python.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time hand tracking using webcam and MediaPipe
- Calculates joint angles of fingers from hand landmarks
- Simulates a 6DOF robotic hand using matplotlib 3D visualization
- Smooth GUI interface with side-by-side live update

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Ensure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Press `q` to exit the simulation window.

## 🎮 Output

* Left: Webcam feed with live MediaPipe hand tracking
* Right: 3D robot hand mimicking finger joint angles

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Add wrist rotation and full pose mimicry
* Dual-hand tracking for bimanual robots
* Export joint data to ROS 2 or CSV
* Build physical robotic hand for real-world mimicry
