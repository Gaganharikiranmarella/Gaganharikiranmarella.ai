# 📊 Sentiment-Aware Trader Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes how trader behavior varies based on market sentiment — specifically during periods of **Fear** and **Greed**. It combines sentiment classification data with real trade execution logs to understand patterns in trade count, volume, and profitability.

## 📊 Objectives

- Merge real-world trading data with sentiment data
- Analyze how sentiment influences:
  - Trade activity (count)
  - Volume per trade (`size`)
  - Profitability (`closed_pnl`)
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter / Colab for interactive EDA
- DOCX for automated report generation

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or upload the folder to your environment (VS Code / Colab)
2. Make sure the two datasets are in `csv_files/`
3. Run `notebook_1.ipynb`
4. Visuals and merged data will be saved to `outputs/` and `csv_files/` respectively
